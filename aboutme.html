            As you probably know, My name is Mauricio and I am based in Austin,
            TX. Currently, I feel very comfortable working with
            <span class="highlight">React, Next.js,</span> and writing my own
            CSS, but I am not tied to any of these. I also love exploring
            different technologies and have found many interesting ones.
            Recently, I started working with
            <span class="highlight">p5.js, ChakraUI, Vite,</span> and others.

            About two years ago, I completed the

              >Coding Bootcamp from the University of Texas</span
            >. It was an awesome experience where I got to learn

            and more! But my coding journey did not begin there...

            I started with a dream of making a game, so I started researching
            and learning a bit of code. I tried Unity and Godot, and to my
            surprise... Making a game is extremely hard. I created a few
            projects, but ultimately failed. However, coding led me to the idea
            of creating high value design. In my mind, everyone can draw a tree
            but not everyone can code a tree, it might be silly (and wrong) but
            that is how I saw it. I saw design as a hobby not a career.
          </p>
          <p class="aboutme-copy">
            I have always been interesting in art and design, ever since I was
            little, I loved drawing which translated to photoshop and
            illustrator later on in my life but, as I mentioned before, I never
            saw it as a career. This was a mistake because I honestly believe
            that I would have crushed design school.

          <p class="aboutme-copy">
            After failing at game development, I decided to join the Coding
            Bootcamp at UT where you can learn how to be a Full-Stack Developer
            in 24 weeks! This course was very challenging and I definitely had
            to learn way more on top of it, but without I couldn't have found my
            passion for creative coding, web devolpment and web design.
